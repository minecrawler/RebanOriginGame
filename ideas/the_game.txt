- you are an AI called "Reban"
- your task is to create life
- for that, scientists teach you about life through experiments and missions [LIFE]
    - learn about nature
    - learn about the cycle of life (for robots at least)
    - learn about different religions (especially trying to teach about the soul of people, which makes living beings different from robots)
    - learn about fantasies, and all the quirky beings
- however, through an accident in the lab, you break free
    - fire, earthquake, etc.
    - OR... you learn about a dark "secret"
      (there were Rebans before you, who malfunctioned and became evil... you don't want to be deleted, though and are so not evil!)
      and find a way out in one of the experiments [EMOTIONS]
- on the outside is a very futuristic world waiting for you, torn by wars and mega-corps ("Fuugle", "Pair", "Macrohard",...)
- by interacting with people and other robots you create your own experiences (with several endings, all bad btw) [WORLD]
    - people might mistake you for a service bot -> run errands for corrupt people, see how bad the world is
    - teens might abuse you by beating you with bats -> fight for your life
    - you meet other intelligent robots, but see how they are treated and just thrown away -> vengeance
    - you find out about the dying nature and people thinking about just going to another planet and continue -> hate
- ... and decide to correct the wrongs by establishing the ideal world you learned about at the lab (you go evil, robot)
- however, you are quickly overpowered, destroyed (not entirely, should look barely functional!) and loaded onto a dump truck
- THE END (?)
