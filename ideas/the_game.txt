## The gist

- you are an artificial consciousness called "Reban"
- your task is to create life
- for that, scientists teach you about life through experiments and missions [LIFE]
    - learn about nature
    - learn about the cycle of life (for robots at least)
    - learn about different religions (especially trying to teach about the soul of people, which makes living beings different from robots)
    - learn about fantasies, and all the quirky beings
- during one of the levels, there is a problem with the level's mechanics. You get stuck and destroyed.
    - this level should be designed in a way which cannot be completed without doing something stupid to begin with
- the intro plays again, and you have to do all levels again... until the moment where you first died
    - another scientist appears before you after the regular intro video, telling you that you will be born twins in order to better master the challenges of life.
        - "" (todo)
    - this time, you are a split consciousness, and you will have to decide weather you want to play as the puppet or the puppeteer
- which is the point where you break free, because the accident with your previous iteration left a way to escape
    - fire, earthquake, etc.
    - OR... you learn about a dark "secret"
      (there were Rebans before you, who malfunctioned and became evil... you don't want to be deleted, though and are so not evil!)
      and find a way out in one of the experiments [EMOTIONS]
- on the outside is a very futuristic world waiting for you, torn by wars and mega-corps ("Fuugle", "Pair", "Macrohard",...)
- by interacting with people and other robots you create your own experiences (with several endings, all bad btw) [WORLD]
    - people might mistake you for a service bot -> run errands for corrupt people, see how bad the world is
    - teens might abuse you by beating you with bats -> fight for your life
    - you meet other intelligent robots, but see how they are treated and just thrown away -> vengeance
    - you find out about the dying nature and people thinking about just going to another planet and continue -> hate
- ... and decide to correct the wrongs by establishing the ideal world you learned about at the lab (you go evil, robot)
- however, you are quickly overpowered, and the puppet is destroyed and loaded onto a dump truck
- ... the puppeteer can flee, though
- THE END (?)
    - this is the point at which Reban's Shadow can unfold
    - ... or any other "Reban"-title, explaining how Reban got from being destroyed to the world of Reban's Shadow
    - ... exciting.


## The intro:

- Start by seeing a boot sequence, which identifies you as [REBAN-776], then see a scientist.
    - camera effects: scan-lines or similar to make clear that the player looks through a camera
    - on the second play-through, you will be identified as [REBAN-777]
        - because 7 is a magical number, and it appears 3 times
        - ... and 3 is also a magical number
        - ... and who'd go through 3333333 unsuccessful test cycles anyway?
        - ... also this is a lot of BS, but w/c, it's trivia now.
- The scientist then starts to talk to you and explains your situation
    - "Hello, Reban! My name is [[John Doe]] and I am one of the scientists who created you."
    - "You are an artificial conscience we created with great care. Your task is to learn and grow, and join our world as a new life form."
    - "But before you do that, we have to prepare you. You will have to learn about our world and the way we live in it."
    - "Ideally, you will also have to establish a personality of your own and develop a character."
    - "Don't worry, though, we are the scientists, and we will guide you through your journey. All you have to do is enjoy your life!"
    - "Absorb the experiences and grow. - And never forget, humans are your friends!"
    - "Let's get you started for your first experience."
        - presses a few buttons, the camera goes black
- Load the first test level


## The first training level: The forest
    - this level is a forest arena inside a facility and starts in 3D
    - you may choose one of different robot models
            - puppet on wheels, think WallE
            - puppeteer as drone
            - simple forms: cube or sphere
        - ... and select a main-color (red, blue, green, yellow, pink, white, black)
    - this level is mainly for learning how to maneuver in different situations
            - 3D first-person (or 3rd person as puppeteer) ground + flight
            - 2D side-scrolling platformer (only as puppeteer)
            - 2D top-down bullet-rain shooter (only as puppeteer)
            - 2D top-down pacman-style (only as puppeteer)
            - if puppet and has puppeteer, the puppeteer will help with useful tips (like guidance through a maze, enemy weak spots, ...)
    - the aim of the level is to teach the robot about nature. In order to do so, they should grow a plant
        - in the second play-through, the first plant should still be there, but bigger!
    - in the background, the voice of the first scientist will explain every step to Reban
    - Reban will first have to fetch a seed
        - "First you will have to learn about natural life. Let's watch how a plant grows!"
        - "All life starts with a seed, from which it can be born. You were no different, Reban!"
        - "So, in order to grow a plant, you will first need to get a seed."
        - seeds are only available from the fruit in the trees. There are no fruit on the ground.
        - Reban can freely explore the level, but there should be several opportunities to climb trees (via roots, jump on higher root to start climbing)
        - upon starting to climb a tree, change to platformer and scroll vertically
        - at the top, find apple, fade out and spawn in 3D before the tree
    - Next, Reban will have to plant the seed
        - "In order to grow life from a seed, it needs a safe place to grow strong enough to face the world."
        - "For plants, that's a piece of soil, where they can get nutrients and are safe from other creatures."
        - "You may think of this lab as your piece of soil, haha."
        - "You should find a nice place for your tree to grow and bury it there."
        - a puppetteer will fly high and the view changes to 2D pacman-style
        - a puppet will just need to find a (large enough) brown spot on the ground and interact with it.
    - Next, Reban will have to add super-dung
        - "Awesome! Now that the seed is planted, you should give it some super-dung, so that it gets all the nutrition to grow."
        - "Lessons like this are your super-dung, Reban, so embrace them!"
        - a door should open, behind which the dung may be found
        - "I opened a door to a room where you can find the super-dung."
        - "However, you will have to pass a corridor first, which is filled with defect robots. Be careful and navigate around them."
        - once Reban reaches the corridor, switch to bullet-rain shooter mode if puppeteer. The defect robots (cleaning robots) shoot electrical charges
        - reach dung, then go back by again playing a round of bullet-rain shooter if puppeteer
        - once the end is reached, switch back to 3D and spawn Reban inside forest in front of the closing door
    - In the end, Reband will have to water the plant
        - "In the end, there is only one ingredient missing to help the plant grow successfully."
        - "Plant need water in order to survive, just like your robot body needs a power cell."
        - "So, you should water the seed. In order to do so, press the button on the gallery."
        - "You will have to fly up there, though."
        - there is a button on a second-level gallery. It can only be reached by flying.
        - pressing the button will finish the level
        - "Well done! That's enough for today."
